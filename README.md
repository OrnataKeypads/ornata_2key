# ornata_2key
this is just basically an attempt at making a 2 key pcb for macro pads and stuff. im using ai03's guide for this, so just bear with me, ok?
so basically in this pcb, im trying to include 5-pin hotswap sockets. im gonna make the entire thing open source, or at least try.
this is one of my first attempts at making pcbs, so just let me know if i messed somethings up, ESPECIALLY with the fp files.
